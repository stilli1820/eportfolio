As I reflect on my recent book cover project, I can’t help but smile at the choice I made: "The Lord of the Rings." This beloved childhood read holds a special place in both my husband’s and my heart. It’s more than just a story; it’s a shared adventure that has woven itself into the fabric of our lives. Creating a cover that embodies this cherished tale felt like a labor of love.

I dove into the project using Photoshop, excited to explore its robust photo editing tools. The first step was finding the right images—ones that could evoke the magic and grandeur of Middle-earth. After browsing through countless options, I finally settled on two high-resolution images from Freefoto that seemed to capture the essence of the story beautifully.

The creative process began with enhancing the vibrance of the first image. I spent time cropping it to improve the composition, ensuring that every detail drew the viewer in. As I worked, I found myself reminiscing about the countless times I had read the book, recalling the vivid landscapes and unforgettable characters. It was as if I was stepping back into my childhood.

Next, I added the second image as a new layer. Isolating its background with the Quick Selection Tool was a bit tricky, but it was also incredibly satisfying. Blending the two images using the Refine Edge tool required patience and a keen eye for detail, but seeing them come together was worth every moment.

One of the highlights of this project was adding the title with the Type Tool. I loved experimenting with different fonts and colors, trying to find the perfect match for the book’s theme. Typography can really set  </p>

For this project, I designed a logo for a fictitious business called "Studio Alegría," meaning "happiness" in Spanish, reflecting my dream of establishing a creative studio in the future. The logo aims to embody a positive and uplifting spirit. Using Photoshop, I created each element from scratch, focusing on a clean, non-busy style.
I started with a background layer, then added an ellipse and a polygon shape, adjusting their colors to create harmony. I chose colors that evoke creativity and joy, aligning with the studio's name. For the text, I selected a font and color that integrated well with the shapes, ensuring a balanced composition.
To emphasize the studio's creative identity, I included a smaller ellipse resembling a painter’s palette, using the paintbrush tool for colorful accents. Overall, my design choices reflect the studio's artistic and joyful theme, using bright colors and clean shapes to convey creativity, fun, and professionalism.
