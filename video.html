                <p>Creating my educational video about Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) was a journey that went beyond simple storytelling; it became a heartfelt exploration of a rich cultural tradition. This celebration, which honors our loved ones who have passed away, is deeply meaningful, and I wanted to convey that significance to my audience.

As I began this project, I spent hours searching for the perfect high-resolution images on Unsplash.com. Each image I chose was not just visually appealing but also filled the screen with vibrant colors and emotions, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the beauty of the holiday. Initially, I planned to use Windows MovieMaker for editing, but when I discovered it was unavailable, I felt a wave of frustration. However, I quickly pivoted and embraced Microsoft Clipchamp. This shift taught me the importance of adaptability, and I found that Clipchamp offered some fantastic tools to bring my vision to life.

One of the most rewarding aspects of the editing process was applying the Ken Burns Effect. It allowed me to create a slow zoom on the intricate details of the bread, which is such a vital part of the celebration. For the sugar skulls, I chose a reverse slow zoom, letting viewers appreciate their artistry from a fresh angle. I also included a slow zoom on marigolds, using a black-and-white removal effect to make their colors pop. These choices were not just technical; they were about capturing the essence of the celebration.

Throughout the video, I added captions to provide context, sharing stories and insights that I hoped would resonate with viewers. I made sure to include formal titles and credits to acknowledge my sources, emphasizing the importance of honoring those who contributed to my understanding of this beautiful tradition. The background music from Microsoft Clipchamp created an atmosphere that complemented the visuals, enhancing the emotional impact without overpowering the message.

Reflecting on this project, I realize it was more than just creating a video; it was about sharing a piece of my heart and fostering a deeper appreciation for the Day of the Dead. I aimed to create a connection with my audience, helping them understand the beauty and significance of this celebration. In the end, I believe I succeeded in crafting a cohesive and engaging narrative that speaks to the importance of remembering and honoring those we’ve lost. </p>
