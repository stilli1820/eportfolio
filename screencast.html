					<h2>Screencasting</h2>
					<p> For this assignment, I decided to create a screencast video tutorial on how to create a Pivot Table in Excel. This topic is close to my heart because I often deal with large datasets at work, and I realized how helpful it could be for others to learn this skill. It’s amazing how something that seems routine to me can be a game-changer for someone else.

I chose Camtasia for the project, which has become my go-to tool for screen recording and editing. To kick things off, I wrote a short script that was about 2-3 minutes long. This helped me organize my thoughts and figure out how to explain the process clearly. Recording the tutorial was quite an experience! As I spoke through the steps, I found myself reflecting on the nuances of using Pivot Tables, which made me appreciate just how valuable this knowledge is.

Once I had my recording, I jumped into the editing phase in Camtasia. I wanted to make sure the final product was polished, so I carefully cut out any awkward pauses and gaps. I added a background and highlighted the mouse pointer to make it easier for viewers to follow along. It was fun to incorporate drag icons, zoom effects, and even doodle animations to keep the tutorial engaging. I really wanted to create something that felt lively and inviting.

After finishing the edits, I exported the video in .mp4 format and uploaded it to YouTube. That felt like a significant milestone! I also took some time to customize the screencasting.html and index.html files for my e-portfolio. Looking back, this project not only helped me improve my technical skills but also reminded me of the joy of sharing knowledge. I’m excited to hear feedback and continue honing my screencasting skills in future projects!. </p>
