                <p> Adding an animation project to the ePortfolio was especially exciting, as it made the content more engaging and interactive. It was a chance to bring my work to life and create something that captures attention while showcasing creativity. However, the process wasn’t without its challenges. Learning to use the animation software took time and patience. The interface wasn’t always intuitive, and troubleshooting small issues—like syncing movements or fixing awkward transitions—could be frustrating. There were also moments when the tool felt limiting, as I couldn’t always customize it exactly how I imagined.

Despite these hurdles, I came away with a stronger understanding of how animation and digital media can elevate a presentation. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me to be more flexible and resourceful. While the learning curve was steep, the sense of accomplishment when the animation finally came together made it all worth it.

Overall, this ePortfolio project has been much more than just a class assignment. It’s a creative space that highlights my abilities and growth, showing not only what I’ve done but also what I’m capable of. It’s also been a reminder of the importance of adapting to new tools and challenges—skills that will serve me well in the future. </p>
