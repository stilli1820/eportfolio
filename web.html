                <p>Creating the "Video Game Pop Quiz" was a journey that really allowed me to blend my love for gaming with my coding skills. I started by using Notepad++ for both the JavaScript and HTML files. This choice felt right because Notepad++ is straightforward and efficient, making it a great tool for someone like me who enjoys diving into code without unnecessary distractions. Hosting the quiz on GitHub was another rewarding step; it not only made the quiz accessible to friends and fellow gamers but also introduced me to the world of version control, which is invaluable in software development.

One of the first things I wanted to do was make the quiz visually appealing. I’ve always believed that a good design can transform an ordinary project into something special. So, I added a background image that reflects the vibrant world of video games. Finding the perfect image was a bit of a challenge, but it was worth it. It needed to be eye-catching but not so busy that it distracted from the quiz itself. I also updated the title to “Video Game Pop Quiz,” making sure it stood out and set the tone for what players could expect.

When it came to the font, I chose Arial for its clarity. I used the CSS code font-family: 'Arial', cursive;, which not only made the text easier to read but gave it a fresh, modern look. This attention to detail in design has become something I genuinely enjoy as I continue to hone my coding skills.

The JavaScript portion was where the real fun began. I customized all the questions and answers to fit the video game theme, which added a personal touch and made the quiz more engaging. Increasing the total number of questions to 10 allowed me to explore different aspects of gaming, creating a more rounded experience for players.

To make the quiz even more interactive, I added some encouraging phrases like "Amazing!" and "Nailed it! You're on fire!" I believe these little touches can really enhance the player’s experience, turning a simple quiz into a fun challenge. Overall, this project has been a fantastic learning experience. It’s not just about coding; it’s about creating something enjoyable that resonates with others..

                <p>The assignment to create a Video Game Drag & Drop Quiz was both a challenge and a joy for me. It provided a fantastic opportunity to dive into HTML, CSS, and GitHub for hosting, all while exploring the fun world of video games. As someone who loves gaming, I was excited to combine my technical skills with my passion.

When I started with the CSS modifications, I decided to change the font to 'Times New Roman.' It might seem like a small detail, but I wanted to enhance readability while giving a classic vibe that many people find comforting. Choosing a warm background color (#b3b69a) was another important decision. It creates a cozy atmosphere, allowing the content to stand out without overwhelming users. I wanted everyone to feel relaxed and engaged while playing the quiz.

One of the standout changes was updating the drag container's background to #317082. This vibrant color not only makes the draggable items pop but also adds an element of fun and excitement. I found myself reflecting on how colors can significantly affect mood and interaction, and I aimed to create a visually appealing environment that encourages users to dive right in.

On the HTML side, I had a blast updating the character boxes to feature popular characters that resonate with a wide audience. It was essential for me to make the quiz relatable and enjoyable. I also modified the box identifiers to align with their respective games, which made navigation much clearer. It felt rewarding to improve the user experience in such a tangible way.

Rewriting the instructional text was another key part of the process. I wanted to ensure that users could easily understand how to play the game, so I focused on making the guidance straightforward and friendly. Lastly, updating the drag-in boxes to display the correct characters in their game locations truly enhanced the functionality and interaction.

Reflecting on this project, I realized how crucial thoughtful design choices and clear communication are in creating an engaging experience. This assignment not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for user-centered design principles. It was a rewarding journey that combined my love for gaming with my desire to create something enjoyable for others.
